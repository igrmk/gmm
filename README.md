Google My Maps to MAPS.ME KML converter
=======================================

MAPS.ME just ignores colors and icon images on importing Google My Maps KML.
This simple tool keeps colors.
They are not the same as in the original KML from Google but they are as close as possible.

Usage
-----

    ./gmm.py google-maps.kml > maps-me.kml
